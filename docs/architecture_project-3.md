# Architecture — Automation Alchemy

How the pieces fit together. GitHub and Gitea render the Mermaid diagrams directly.

## 1. VMs and network

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    browser["Admin laptop<br/>browser: localhost:8080"]

    subgraph net["VirtualBox host-only network 192.168.56.0/24"]
        lb["load-balancer .10<br/>nginx least_conn"]
        w1["web-server-1 .11<br/>frontend"]
        w2["web-server-2 .12<br/>frontend"]
        app["app-server .13<br/>backend"]
        cicd["cicd-server .14<br/>Ansible + Jenkins"]
        bk["backup-server .15<br/>(bonus)"]
    end

    hub[("Docker Hub")]
    gh[("GitHub")]
    slack(["Slack"])

    browser -- "8080 -> 80" --> lb
    lb --> w1 & w2
    w1 & w2 -- ":3000" --> app
    cicd -- "poll" --> gh
    cicd -- "push images" --> hub
    hub -- "pull images" --> w1 & w2 & app
    cicd -- "notify" --> slack
```

Not drawn, to keep the picture readable: **SSH** (port 22). The laptop and cicd-server
(Ansible) can SSH into every VM. In bonus mode, backup-server can SSH into every core VM,
but only to run the backup export (section 5).

**Traffic rules (UFW, deny by default):**

| To | Port | Allowed from |
|---|---|---|
| every VM | 22 | admin laptop, cicd-server (+ backup-server in bonus mode) |
| load-balancer | 80 | anyone (the public entry point) |
| web servers | 80 | load-balancer only |
| app-server | 3000 | web servers only |
| cicd-server | 8080 | admin laptop only |

The containers run with `network_mode: host`. With published ports, Docker writes its
own iptables rules and **bypasses UFW**; host networking keeps UFW in charge.

## 2. How the infrastructure is built

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    actor You
    participant UP as up.ps1
    participant V as Vagrant
    participant VMs as 4 core VMs
    participant C as cicd-server
    participant A as Ansible (site.yml)

    You->>UP: .\scripts\up.ps1 -Fresh
    UP->>V: vagrant destroy -f, then vagrant up
    V->>VMs: create VM, bootstrap.sh (devops user + public key)
    V->>C: created LAST, bootstrap.sh installs Ansible + private key + vault password
    C->>A: run site.yml
    A->>C: firewall on the control node first
    A->>VMs: patches, hardening, firewall (all VMs)
    A->>VMs: Docker, first images, app deploy, nginx
    A->>C: Jenkins with JCasC (credentials + 2 jobs)
    C-->>You: Jenkins polls GitHub and deploys the newest commit
```

**One source of truth.** `ansible/inventory/hosts.yml` lists every VM with its IP, RAM
and CPUs. The Vagrantfile reads the same file, so an IP is never written twice.
The nginx upstream list, the firewall rules and `/etc/hosts` are generated from it too.

**Order matters.**
- cicd-server is created last because it configures all the others.
- Its own firewall goes up **before** Ansible connects anywhere. Turning UFW on later
  dropped Ansible's open connections and froze the run (see the notes, incident 2).
- The app is deployed **before** the load balancer, so nginx never points at empty servers.

## 3. Ansible roles

| Role | Runs on | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `common` | all | security patches (+ reboot if a new kernel needs it), base packages, hostname, `/etc/hosts`, timezone |
| `hardening` | all | devops password + sudo, removes bootstrap sudo, locks default accounts, SSH policy, umask 0027, unattended-upgrades |
| `firewall` | all | UFW deny-by-default + only the ports in section 1 |
| `docker` | web, app, cicd | Docker Engine from Docker's signed apt repo, log size limit |
| `image_build` | cicd | builds and pushes the `initial` images (only if missing) |
| `app_deploy` | web, app | runs one container, waits for `/health` |
| `loadbalancer` | lb | nginx config generated from the inventory, syntax check before reload |
| `jenkins` | cicd | Java 21, Jenkins LTS, plugins, JCasC, secrets, self-check of the jobs |
| `fail2ban` | all (bonus) | SSH jail, bans through UFW |
| `backup_server` | backup (bonus) | backup key, `backup-pull` script, systemd service + daily timer |
| `backup_source` | core (bonus) | `backup-export` script, sudo rule for it, locked authorized key |

`deploy.yml` (used by Jenkins and the rollback job) runs only `app_deploy`:
backend first, then the web servers with `serial: 1`.

## 4. The CI/CD pipeline

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    commit(["git push to GitHub"]) --> poll["Jenkins polls every 2 min"]
    poll --> s1["1. Version<br/>tag = short commit ID<br/>record live version"]
    s1 --> s2["2. Code checks<br/>Ruff, Bandit, pytest"]
    s2 --> s3["3. Build images"]
    s3 --> s4["4. Image scan<br/>Trivy CRITICAL with fix"]
    s4 --> s5["5. Push to Docker Hub<br/>+ build-info.txt"]
    s5 --> s6["6. Deploy<br/>Ansible deploy.yml, rolling"]
    s6 --> s7["7. Smoke test<br/>through the load balancer"]
    s7 --> s8["8. Load test<br/>k6"]
    s8 --> ok(["Slack: Deployed"])

    s1 & s2 & s3 & s4 & s5 -- "fail" --> blocked(["Slack: Blocked<br/>nothing deployed"])
    s6 & s7 & s8 -- "fail" --> rb["Deploy the previous version<br/>+ smoke test"]
    rb -- "ok" --> rolled(["Slack: Rolled back"])
    rb -- "fail" --> rbf(["Slack: Rollback failed"])
```

**Versioning.** Every image is tagged with the 7-character commit ID, so any running
container traces back to exactly one commit. The frontend shows the version on the page
and on `/health`. Rollback reads the live version from `/health` **before** deploying.

**Rolling deploy.** `serial: 1` updates one web server at a time and waits for its
health check. Meanwhile nginx sends users to the other server, so there is no downtime.

**Manual rollback** (`automation-alchemy-rollback` job):

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    p["Build with Parameters<br/>VERSION = 41d92ac"] --> c["Check the format<br/>7 hex chars or 'initial'"]
    c --> d["deploy.yml -e image_tag=VERSION"]
    d --> t["Smoke test"]
    t --> n(["Slack: Manual rollback done"])
```

**Jenkins as code.** Nothing is configured by clicking. Ansible writes `casc.yaml`
(admin user, permissions, credentials, both jobs as Job DSL). Secrets come from the
vault and are written to files only Jenkins can read. JCasC reads them with
`${readFile:...}`, so they never appear in `casc.yaml`.

## 5. Backups (bonus)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T as systemd timer (02:00)
    participant B as backup-server
    participant S as core VM (x5)

    T->>B: start backup-pull.service
    loop every core VM
        B->>S: ssh -i backup_key devops@vm
        Note over S: authorized_keys forces<br/>command="sudo -n /usr/local/bin/backup-export",restrict
        S-->>B: tar.gz of /etc (+ /var/lib/jenkins on cicd) on stdout
        B->>B: gzip -t, then save as /srv/backups/vm/vm-DATE.tar.gz
    end
    B->>B: delete archives older than 7 days
```

**Why pull, not push:** only the backup server holds a key. A hacked web server
cannot read, change or delete any backup. The key it accepts can do exactly one
thing: run `backup-export`. It gets no shell, no port forwarding and no terminal.

Password hashes (`/etc/shadow`) and private SSH host keys are excluded from the archives.
